SCC Multiverse: A pythoon librrarry to calculate CIL's Social Cost of Carbon
============================================================================

*scc_multiverse* is an open-sourced project developed at the `Climate Impact
Lab`_ at the University of Chicago. This library will read results from different
monetized damage projections from different realms (also knows as sectors, in CIL
parlance) and allow the user to diagnose, aggregate, and calculate the social
cost of carbon: the social welfare cost of an additional metric ton of CO2 in
monetary terms. 

The `scc_multiverse` offers an easy framework to load and quickly analyze data.
Most of the code relies heavily on `xarray` and `Dask`. The first is essential
to do different operations based on labels, while the second one allows
*bigger-than-memory* calculations, while offering a generalizable interface that
can be executed on a local machine, and HPC system, or a cloud computing
service.
